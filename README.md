# Self-Hosting Guide
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please note that this is only for advanced users who have opted for self hosting the bot and it's services
>
> It is recommended that you deploy this service before deploying the [bot](https://github.com/Egg-03/PaperTrailBot?tab=readme-ov-file#self-hosting-guide) itself since the bot relies on the URL of this service to communicate. This service is only required for PaperTrail versions 2.0.0 and above.
>
> This is not a public API and should not be publicly exposed and should be accessible only by the services within the local network. If deploying on platforms like Northflank, Render, or Railway, ensure this service is not exposed externally and is only accessible to the bot service.
>
> This API is in early stages of development

The following guide shows how to set up the API service
